Question: In an API endpoint that returns a list of users and their posts, the developer wrote:

users := db.FindAllUsers()
for _, u := range users {
    u.Posts = db.FindPostsByUserID(u.ID)
}

How many database queries will this code execute if there are N users?

At the end, summarize the answers and choose the most consistent one, ignoring outliers.
If there are 3 different answers, ONLY reply: "I can't find a consistent answer".
